#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) It's dependent upon the input size. Runs one while statement (condition) and returns a math operation as the only given information


b) O(n^2) You have an iteration and a nested condition so each time it does the outer loop the inner loop runs.


c) O(n) We have a single operation based on input size

## Exercise II

Given a building n tall
how to determine when the egg did not break??
drop an egg from bottom level  up until the egg breaks
the previous floor is the highest the egg can be dropped without breaking

The runtime is O(n)
